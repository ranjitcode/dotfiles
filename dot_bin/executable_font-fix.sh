# 3 - update font cache via fc-cache
fc-cache
echo "Noto Emoji Font installed! You may need to restart applications like chrome. If chrome displays no symbols or no letters, your default font contains emojis."
echo "consider inconsolata regular"

The first part is to install the package noto-fonts-emoji. The parameter --needed is used to only download and install the package, if it's not already installed.
The second part is just creating a config file and saving it.
The third part with fc-cache is the refresh of the font cache.

I recommend Inconsolata Nerd Font Mono Regular or any other font without emojis as system font. If you see numbers as emojis in your Browser, it is likely that your current system font contains emojis itself (DejaVu is one example) and you need to switch to a different font so you get the colored emojis.

Update 20.02.2020
There is a much easier way and I edited this post to contain the new information. Before there was a bit trial and error to find out the number for the font config file. With the new way, it's just one file.

Great post!
But I noticed that <?xml version="1.0"?> evaluates to <?xml version=1.0?> (in zsh) which causes a syntax error when running fc-cache.
The same thing happens for <!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">. Escaping the double quotes fixes this.

I believe changing double quotes to single quotes would avoid the error from coming up. Other than that, the script is great! I've been trying to do smth like this for some time now, so thank you for writing this!

It works better then ArchWiki itself.

However, it destroyed my Conkies. I have to tweak them a bit.

Lastly, > /etc/fonts/local.conf is dangerous. You should either use a text editor or backup first.

I would also consider using fc-cache -v, instead of fc-cache.

Almost perfect

Actually, only ALMOST perfect.

Do you know how I could get this script working with Twitter Emoji Color (aka twemoji)?

I replaced all lines with <family>Noto Color Emoji</family> with <family>Twitter Color Emoji</family>, but it didn't work.

Go into whatever your font management application is for your DE, and then search for the font's name. Whatever name shows up in the font manager is the name that you have to use in the section. It's how I found out to use JoyPixels for my emojis.

The easiest way would be if you have a backup of your /etc/fonts/local.conf file or didn't had this file at all before!
In that case, either restore the backup file or delete the /etc/fonts/local.conf file completely and run fc-cache.

In case you have no backup and had customizations in that file before, open it with an editor and remove all lines containing the emoji font (in this case e.g. Noto...). Save and run fc-cache.
